SUPABASE_URL=https://YOUR_PROJECT.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# IMPORTANT: Use the SERVICE ROLE key for the server (not the anon key)
# The service role key has elevated permissions and should NEVER be exposed to clients

# ============================================
# NOTES
# ============================================
# - The server will run without Supabase, but won't have:
#   - Database persistence for game rooms
#   - JWT authentication validation
#   - Reconnection support
#   - Spectator mode
# - To get your service key:
#   1. Go to Supabase dashboard
#   2. Project Settings → API
#   3. Copy the "service_role" key (under "Project API keys")
